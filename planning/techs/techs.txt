Techs in Conquer Space work a bit different from other games. In other games, it is possible to
research all the techs in the tech tree. 
In Conquer Space, it is different. All sciences has a chance to be revealed, and if it does, it can
be researched, and not all sciences may be researched in order to get to some high tech 
thingy. There will be multiple paths to one goal.
For example, for ftl, there will be:
Wormholes,
Hyperspace, etc...

All sciences are attributed to `fields`, which have to be unlocked by researching.
