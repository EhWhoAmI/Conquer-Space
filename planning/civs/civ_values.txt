Civ values:
Here is a basic list of all the civ values, and what they are gonna be used for.

optics.quality - Used for the quality of optics. As you know, optics increase in the sharpness, or quality, which leads up to seeing better and further; they see based on their size. To see further, you need a bigger lens. It's as simple as that, like in real life. The issue is, to see super far, you need an enormous lens (i.e., the size of the solar system). But, don't worry, you only need such insane sizes if you want to see wookies in a galaxy, far, far away. 
               - This value signifies the quality of the optics, and the multiplier value is the quality divided by 10
               - The pi r squared equation will be quite useful...
               - Size is in per 10cm (decameters)
               - So the equation would be something like this: f(x) = ln (pi * (size, or radius)^2 + 1) * 2= range
               - For the mass, the equation will be also p * r ^ 2 * quality
