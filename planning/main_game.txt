Conquer Space, is a space themed game.

The goal is open ended, though the aim will mostly be:

Conquer Space!

We will try our best to simulate a real empire and things like that. A space one.

We need to accept that other empires are unlike us humans, and may be different, from the
very fundementals. Culture, and every thing there is. But, we kinda need to have 
something similar to humans, because that's all we got. I mean, have you ever met an alien?
(Ok maybe if some archeologist finds this in the far future and we humans have met aliens.
then yes.)

Though there may be aliens, there is just as much chance there are none. (Unless you are
in the future and have met aliens. In that case, danm it) So, we may have a galaxy where there
are no other civilizations, and your own splits as it goes. That will do.

Our focus will be on diplomacy, not killing people. There is a victory condition on 'Peace'.

Try Stellaris. I was inspired by that.
