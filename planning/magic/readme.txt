Yes, you will ask me, what on earth (or space) are you thinking? Magic in a sci-fi game?

Well, here you go. Magic. In a sci-fi game.

It is just an idea, but I think it could go quite far.

You must be open to new ideas, as magic, might exist on other alien worlds, or something like
magic. Maybe they have some kind of force like thingy, you know, Star Wars and that stuff
Its pretty magic to me. (Though our magic might be leaning more to the Harry Potter magic
kind)
