Stars have 9 types based on the Hertzsprung–Russell diagram.

Hottest/bluer
O
B
A
F
G - Our sun is a G2 star. 
K
M
L
T
Coolest/redder

We can skip the subdivisions. We do need it to be so detailed/

Their rarity in the main sequence:
They consist of 90% of stars.
O 0.00003%
B 0.13%
A 0.6%
F 3%
G 7.6%
K 12.1%
M 76.45%
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_classification#Harvard_spectral_classification)

But we will use this, so mathematically its easier, and also for the code.
O 0.07%
B 0.13%
A 0.7%
F 3%
G 9%
K 12.1%
M 75%

Sum is 100%

Star maximum size is 120 solar masses. Which we may calculate to 100 solar radii.(Just a wild guess)
