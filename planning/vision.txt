There are a few types of vision, taken straight from ConquerSpace.game.universe.civilization.vision.VisionTypes:
/**
* Doesn't know it is even there.
 */
public static final int UNDISCOVERED = 0;
/**
 * Knows it exists, but nothing else.
 */
public static final int EXISTS = 1;
/**
 * Knows what is inside, planets and all, but not resources and stuff like that.
 * Does not know distance of planet from star. You know, science, so you can tell
 * from the change in luminosity, but you cannot tell other stuff.
 */
public static final int KNOWS_INTERIOR = 2;
/**
 * Knows what is inside, planets and all.
 * Knows distance from the planet from star.
 */
public static final int KNOWS_DETAILS = 3;
/**
 * Knows whatever is going on, ships and stuff...
 */
public static final int KNOWS_ALL = 4;

Vision calculation works like this:
The vision point will have its own range, say 100 light years.

Vision quality will decrease in a linear fasion, at 100% from the viewpoint, to 0% at the end of the range.

It will add a certain amount of points, and if it surpasses a level, the vision types will slowly be incremented.
