Conquer Space
=======

The general idea: Conquer Space!

We are still coding this thingy, but we hope that this will be rather complex.

We hope to include:
 - Turn based gameplay
 - Espionage
 - Extremely detailed gameplay
### Compiling
This uses [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) to compile, but [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) will do.

`git clone https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/Conquer-Space.git` to clone this repo.
#### For Netbeans
Just open the project folder, and `F6` or the green arrow to compile.

#### For Ant
`cd Conquer-Space` when done with cloning.

run `ant` to compile.

run `ant jar` for making the jar.

`ant run` to run.
