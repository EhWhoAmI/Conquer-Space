### Compiling
This uses [Netbeans](https://netbeans.org/) to compile, but [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org/) will do. However, for the UI, it's better if you use Netbeans. We use their UI layout tool.

`git clone https://github.com/EhWhoAmI/Conquer-Space.git` to clone this repo.

Unless you are doing something you know is not related to scripting. That is if you are experienced enough.

#### For Netbeans
Just open the project folder, and `F6` or the green arrow to compile.

#### For Ant
`cd Conquer-Space` when done with cloning.

run `ant` to compile.

run `ant jar` for making the jar.

`ant run` to run.
