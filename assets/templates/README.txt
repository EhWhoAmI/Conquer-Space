This, is the folder for templates everything.

Templates are used for:
Buildings,
Ships, etc..

A template looks like this:

//So, name is the name of the template.
//Class is the class
//Params is the class of the params, for the constructor.
//Note, we can't do objects, just base types
//Args are arguments, the class.
//Resources are the cost that it takes to build.
